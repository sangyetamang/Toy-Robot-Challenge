# Toy-Robot-Challenge
It is the application which simulates toy robot moving on a square tabletop,  of dimensions 5 units x 5 unit.

This repo contains my different iterations of Toy Robot Challenge.

Fourth Iteration is the most latest one where you can play the game by first entering X, Y position to place the robot.

Then, you can choose which direction to put the robot by pressing "N", "W", "S" and "E" keys.
After you have placed the robot, you can play the game by pressing:

1 -> to move the robot

2 -> to turn right (this will move the direction of the robot clockwise)

3 -> to turn left (this will move the direction of the robot clockwise)

4 -> to quit the game
